INTRO							*readline*

This plugin will add a subset of readline's default bindings to Vim's command
mode.  It implements the most commonly used functionality from readline, which
includes moving and deleting by words and some other stuff.

The word movement and deletion commands implemented by this plugin will skip
word delimeters, this is different from what Vim usually does.  The change is
made to be more like readline, which also has this behavior.

Some mappings will override default Vim functionality (like |c_CTRL-F|).  If the
default Vim functionality is useful, it should still be accessible through other
mappings (like |c_CTRL-X_CTRL-E|).

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS						*readline-mappings*

							*c_CTRL-B*
CTRL-B		Move cursor left.

							*c_CTRL-F*
CTRL-F		Move cursor right.  Use |CTRL-X_CTRL-E| to access the overridden
		VIM mapping.

							*c_<M-f>*
<M-f> or						*c_<M-F>*
<M-F> or						*c_<Esc>f*
<Esc>f or						*c_<Esc>F*
<Esc>F		Move cursor forward to end of word.  Word is delimeted by
		non-alphanumeric characters.

							*c_<M-b>*
<M-b> or						*c_<M-B>*
<M-B> or						*c_<Esc>b*
<Esc>b or						*c_<Esc>B*
<Esc>B		Move cursor back to start of word.  Word is delimeted by
		non-alphanumeric characters.

							*c_CTRL-A*
CTRL-A		Move cursor to beginning of line.  Use |<M-star>| or
		|<Esc>star| to access the overridden Vim default mapping.

							*c_CTRL-E*
CTRL-E		Move cursor to end of line.

							*c_CTRL-H*
CTRL-H or						*c_<BS>*
<BS>		Delete character before cursor.

							*c_CTRL-D*
CTRL-D		Delete character under cursor. Use <M-?> or <Esc>? to access

							*c_<M-C-H>* 
<M-C-H> or						*c_<M-BS>* 
<M-BS> or						*c_<Esc>CTRL-H* 
<Esc>CTRL-H or						*c_<Esc><BS>* 
<Esc><BS>	Delete back to start of previous word.  Word is delimeted by
		non-alphanumeric characters.

							*c_<M-d>* 
<M-d> or						*c_<M-D>* 
<M-D> or						*c_<Esc>d* 
<Esc>d or						*c_<Esc>D* 
<Esc>D		Delete forward to end of word.  Word is delimeted by
		non-alphanumeric characters.

							*c_CTRL-U*
CTRL-U		Delete to beginning of line.

							*c_CTRL-K*
CTRL-K		Delete to end of line.

							*c_CTRL-W* 
CTRL-W		Delete to beginning of previous word.  Word is delimeted by
		spaces.

							*c_CTRL-T*
CTRL-T		Transpose characters before the cursor.

							*c_CTRL-Y*
CTRL-Y		Yank (paste) previously deleted text.  Only text deleted
		through commands which operate on words or lines can be
		recalled.

							*c_<M-u>*
<M-u> or						*c_<M-U>*
<M-U> or						*c_<Esc>u*
<Esc>u or						*c_<Esc>U*
<Esc>U          Make word in front of cursor UPPERCASE.

							*c_<M-l>*
<M-l> or						*c_<M-L>*
<M-L> or						*c_<Esc>l*
<Esc>l or						*c_<Esc>L*
<Esc>L          Make word in front of cursor lowercase.

							*c_<M-c>*
<M-c> or						*c_<M-C>*
<M-C> or						*c_<Esc>c*
<Esc>c or						*c_<Esc>C*
<Esc>C          Make word in front of cursor Capitalized.

							*c_<M-?>*
<M-?>							*c_<Esc>?*
<Esc>?		Display all names that match pattern in front of cursor.
		Replacement for the default |c_CTRL-D| mapping which gets
		overridden.

							*c_<M-star>*
<M-*>							*c_<Esc>star*
<Esc>*		Insert all names that match pattern in front of cursor.
		Replacement for the default |c_CTRL-A| mapping which gets
		overridden.

							*c_CTRL-X_CTRL-E*
CTRL-X CTRL-E	Open command-line window.  See |cmdline| for more information.
		Replacement for the default |c_CTRL-F| mapping which gets
		overridden.

==============================================================================
INSERT MODE					*readline-insert*

This plugin does not add readline-style commands to insert mode.  This is
because it is not very useful, as experienced Vim users will use normal mode
for these commands.  Implementing these mappings in insert mode would also
override a lot of useful default Vim bindings.  Some mappings also use <Esc>
which might cause problems with mode switching if implemented in insert-mode.

==============================================================================
BUGS						*readline-bugs*

This plugin previously had problems dealing with non-ASCII characters in the
command-line.  That has been solved now.  If happen to find new bugs, please
